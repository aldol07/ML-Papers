## 📁 Project Structure

```
/frontend     --> Next.js application
  /src
    /app      --> Next.js 13+ app directory
    /components --> Reusable components
/backend      --> API routes and server logic
/database     --> Mock database setup
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Next.js 13+
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- React Icons
- Framer Motion (for animations)
- Express.js (for backend API)
- Mock Supabase (for database)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Frontend

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Backend (Optional)

The frontend includes a mock API implementation, but you can also run the backend server separately:

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **API will be available at**
   `http://localhost:3001`

### Database (Mock)

The database is mocked using JavaScript and doesn't require a real database connection. The mock implementation is in the `Database` folder.

## 💡 AI Tool Usage Acknowledgement
For this project, I explored and utilized Cursor, an AI-powered code editor built for modern web development. It proved to be an incredibly valuable tool throughout the assignment.

🔍 What I learned from using Cursor:
How to integrate AI seamlessly into the development workflow, without compromising control over logic or design.

The power of real-time, context-aware AI suggestions that adapt based on the structure and intent of my code.

How Cursor can serve as a pair programmer, helping resolve bugs, refactor components, and even optimize layout code without breaking flow.

🚀 Astonishing Benefits I Experienced:
Instant fixes for Tailwind errors and intelligent utility suggestions that saved hours of manual trial-and-error.

Fast component generation using natural language prompts, drastically reducing boilerplate time.

Autocompletion for complex structures like nested layouts, form handling, and animation sequences, especially with Framer Motion.

Code explanation and suggestions that improved my understanding of TypeScript typings and Next.js routing nuances.

Overall, Cursor accelerated my development speed while teaching me cleaner, scalable patterns for building a Gen Z-focused UI.

Using Cursor not only boosted my productivity, but also helped me write better code, faster — and with greater confidence.
